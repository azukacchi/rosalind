# We say that a k-mer Pattern appears as a substring of Text with at most d mismatches
# if there is some k-mer substring Pattern' of Text having d or fewer mismatches with Pattern,
# i.e., HammingDistance(Pattern, Pattern') â‰¤ d. Our observation that a DnaA box may appear with
# slight variations leads to the following generalization of the Pattern Matching Problem.

# Approximate Pattern Matching Problem: Find all approximate occurrences of a pattern in a string.

# Input: Strings Pattern and Text along with an integer d.
# Output: All starting positions where Pattern appears as a substring of Text with at most d mismatches.
